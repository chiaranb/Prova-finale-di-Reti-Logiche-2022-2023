#Final Project of Reti Logiche course at Politecnico di Milano
The purpose of this project is the implementation of a HW module (described in VHDL) that interfaces with a memory.
At a high level of abstraction, the system receives instructions regarding a memory location, whose content must be directed to one of the four available output channels. 
Instructions about the channel to use and the memory address to access are provided through a serial input of one bit, while the system outputs, i.e., the aforementioned channels, provide all the bits of the memory word in parallel.
